                    <p>Over 689 million people live below the poverty line, on less than $1.90 per day.
                        There are many challenges that the poor face such as lack of education, employment, income and productive resources.<br/><br/>
                        Our aim is to help reduce poverty by increasing employment generation and promoting social integration for the poor.<br/><br/>
                        We do this by providing a platform where  the youth/ needy/ poor can find jobs and generate money,
                        obtain scholarships from donors and raise funds for food and healthcare services.
